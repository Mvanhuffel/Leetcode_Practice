## 1. Create a dataframe from list

Write a solution to create a DataFrame from a 2D list called student_data. This 2D list contains the IDs and ages of some students.
The DataFrame should have two columns, student_id and age, and be in the same order as the original 2D list.
```
import pandas as pd

def createDataframe(student_data: List[List[int]]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    column_names = ['student_id', 'age']
    result = pd.DataFrame(student_data, columns=column_names)
    return result
```
